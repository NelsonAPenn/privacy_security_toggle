# Privacy Settings Toggle

Firefox extension that toggles certain privacy / security settings on and off. Helpful for when websites / logins break. The motivation for this extension is largely because first-party isolation is very effective in protecting against trackers; however, it is perhaps the most likely setting to break websites. This extension is designed to quickly and easily turn it off temporarily.

Currently, the extension simply changes settings for first-party isolation and sending referrer headers. When the lock is closed,

- first-party isolation is on
- referrer headers are turned off

When the lock is open, these are reversed. And that's it!
